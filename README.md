## About

This is an unofficial module for the Old-School Essentials system for Foundry VTT. It adapts the base character and monster sheets for use with the Dolmenwood rules. Namely, it adds the attribute modifiers to the character sheet and changes the save and exploration skill names to match the Dolmenwood system. It also provides alternate roll calculations for this character sheet.

## Requirements

This module must be used in a world using VTT Red's `ose` system. For more information, (see their GitHub page.)[https://github.com/vttred/ose]
